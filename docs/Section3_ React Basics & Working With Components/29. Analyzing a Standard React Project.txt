Now, what's that file doing though?

What's happening here?

Well, we are importing ReactDOM from react-dom,

which in the end means we're importing something,

some ReactDOM object

from the react-dom third-party library,

which is one of our dependencies,

which is downloaded and installed locally.

Now, in the package.json file,

you actually see two React dependencies,

react just like that

and then this react-dom thing.

And whilst this indeed technically

are two separate packages,

you can think of that as React, the library.

It's split across two packages

with different responsibilities

but in the end, ReactDOM and React,

these two dependencies together form the React library.
And it's this single HTML(index.html) file

that is the entry point,

the place where the React-driven user interface

should be rendered into so to say.
